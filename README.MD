# Formwidgeter

**Formwidgeter** is a software/firmware combination for Arduino that enables network-enabled Arduino platforms to interface with **Formbar** without requiring firmware reflashing. All credentials (e.g., Access Point SSID, password, Formbar server address, and API key) are saved to the first 320 bytes of the device's EEPROM (64 bytes Ã— 5 parameters).

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Configure network and API credentials without reflashing
- EEPROM-based storage for persistent settings
- Works with standard Arduino sketches

---

## ðŸ”§ Flashing Formwidgeter to an Arduino Device

1. Copy all `.ino` files to your Arduino **Sketch** folder (except `widget.ino`).
2. Open your main sketch and:
   - Copy required function calls from `widget.ino` into your `setup()` and `loop()` functions.
3. Upload your sketch to the Arduino as usual.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updating Credentials

1. Run the configuration tool:
   - Preferred: `app.exe`
   - Alternative (requires Python): `app.py`
2. **Close any open Serial Monitor** that might be using the device.
3. Identify your device's **Serial Port** (install necessary drivers if it doesnâ€™t show up).
4. Set the **baud rate** (default: `115200`).
5. Click **Connect**.
6. Enter and update values (e.g., SSID, password, server address, API key) using the provided UI.
7. Optionally, you can interact directly through the Serial Port as needed.

## ðŸ“¦ EEPROM Layout

- 5 configurable parameters
- 64 bytes per parameter
- Stored in the first 320 bytes of EEPROM

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Always close Serial Monitors before connecting with the configuration tool.
- Using `app.exe` ensures better cross-platform compatibility and user experience.

---

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Arduino-compatible board with EEPROM
- Windows (for `app.exe`) or Python 3 (for `app.py`)
- Arduino IDE (for flashing)
- Serial drivers for your device (if needed)
